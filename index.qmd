Welcome - and thanks for visiting!

In this website you can check [my condensed CV](/cv.html) and [my data portfolio](/projects.html).

I am currently a researcher interested in studying how species are organized in time and space, with a major focus on plants and their functional trait variation across various scales. My research primarily involves the use of large databases and quantitative syntheses to explore shared patterns across different biomes and species.
