Welcome - and thanks for visiting!

In this website you can check [my condensed CV](/cv.html) and [my data portfolio](/projects.html).

My current work as researcher investigates the temporal and spatial organization of species, particularly plants, and their functional trait variation. I employ quantitative syntheses of large databases to uncover common patterns across a wide range of biomes and species.
